    <p1> Coal is a very useful hard and black material collected from mines. The woods buried under the earth for a long time turn into coal by some chemical change. Earthquakes cause vast forest areas to dip underground and help to bring about such changes due to tremendous heat and pressure. In our country coal mines are found at Asansol, Raniganj, Dhanbad, Jharia, Giridih, Chaibasa, etc. India exports coal to Japan, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Coal is used as fuel for domestic purposes and also in factories and industries. Most of the trains and steamers move by consuming coal in steam engines.
