        Someone humorously remarked that our age can be called “The Plastic Age’. Plastic is a non-biodegradable substance. It does not assimilate with soil and reduces the fertility of the land. It cannot be recycled automatically and harms the life cycle on the earth. But, plastic is replacing the traditional use of jute, cotton, or paper materials and is becoming a menace to the living world. Children run the risk of being suffocated while playing with plastic bags. Colored plastic carry-bags cause poisoning of the food. Plastic wastes, if not carefully disposed of, very often lead to the choking of the sewage system.
